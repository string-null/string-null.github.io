<center><b>MalaOS</b> an optimized operative system</center>
     
 I'm a spanish student learning optimization of operating systems, web development and Lua

## What is MalaOS?
* MalaOS is an optimized operating system dedicated for people who have average, low-resource PCs that often suffer from slow performance, stutters. This system has additional tools that it will be good for us to have to optimize our PC and also for people who play video games since MalaOS will allow us to optimize them.
      
## Installation
* Download [MalaOS Iso](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Moon/fork)
* Download [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/)
* Open rufus and select `MalaOS.iso` file. Partition scheme in `GPT` and Target System `UEFI`, File System `FAT32` and Cluster Size `default`.
* Click the `start` button and wait.
* Once the USB is booted, we will proceed to install the operating system. For this we need to enter to boot the computer with the USB, we have to identify which is the boot key with USB of our computer, in my case it is F12.
* Now the computer boots with a windows installation interface but we will be installing MalaOS. Just follow the steps the interface/GUI gives you    
     
That's all. Now go to the Post Install Steps
